# Neural-network
A simple implementation of neural network in python with scratch.  It supports classification and regression tasks, with grid search for model selection, with weight decay, regularization, momentum and learning rate. 

This project was submitted as a part of semester credits in 'Machine Learning by Prof. Micheli' at Universit√† di Pisa.

The playground.ipynb notebook shows the demonstration and test on Monks Datasets.
